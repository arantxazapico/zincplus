% We first recall the unique decoding version of the correlated agreement result for linear codes from~\cite{BKS18}.
% \begin{lemma}[Correlated agreement over affine spaces~\cite{BKS18}]
% \label{lemma:correlated-agreement}

% Let $V \subseteq \field^\blocklength$ be a linear space over a finite field $\field$ with $\Delta(C) = \lambda$. Suppose $u^\ast \in \ring^b$ satisfies $\Delta(u^\ast,C) > \delta$, and fix arbitrary $u \in \ring^b$. Let $\challengeset \subseteq \ring$ be an exceptional set. For $\epsilon > 0$ satisfying $\delta - \epsilon < \lambda/3$. Let
% \[
% A = \{\alpha \in \mathcal{C} \mid \distance{u^\ast + \alpha u}{C} < \delta - \varepsilon\}
% \]
% If $|A| > 1/\varepsilon$ then there exist $v, v^\ast \in C$ such that
% \[
% \bigl|\set{i \in [n] \mid (u_i = v_i) \ \wedge \ (u^\ast_i = v^\ast_i)}\bigr| \geq (1 - \delta)\cdot n
% \]
% \end{lemma}
