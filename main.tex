\subsection{Proximity gaps for infinite rings}
\label{sec:proximity-gap}

\parhead{Informal proximity gap for proposed split encoding}
Consider a projectable linear code $C$ over $\integers$ with a systematic generator matrix $G = [I_{\dim} \ G']$, and a good random choice of $q$. The honest prover will encode a message $m \in \integers^{\dim}$ as $m \| (G'm \bmod q) \in \integers^{\dim} \times \integers_{q}^{\blocklength-\dim}$.

Now consider an arbitrary set of vectors over $v_1,\dotsc,v_{m} \in \integers^{\dim} \times \integers_{q}^{\blocklength-\dim}$, and let $(u_1,\dotsc,u_m) \equiv (v_1,\dotsc,v_{m}) \bmod q$. We know from~\cite[Theorem 4.1]{BKS18} that if there exists $u^\ast \in \set{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \alpha_i u_i \mid \alpha_1,\dotsc,\alpha_m \in \integers_q}$ such that $\reldist{u^\ast}{C} > \delta$, then for any $\epsilon > 0$ such that $\delta-\epsilon < \lambda/3$ it holds that
\[
\Pr_{\alpha \gets \integers_{q}^m} \left[\reldist{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \alpha_i u_i}{C} < \delta - \epsilon\right] < \frac{1}{\epsilon q}
\]
Since for any $\alpha$ we have $\reldist{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \alpha_i v_i}{C} \leq \reldist{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \alpha_i u_i}{C}$, this above result also holds for with respect to the $v_i$.

% We first recall the unique decoding version of the correlated agreement result for linear codes from~\cite{BKS18}.
% \begin{lemma}[Correlated agreement over affine spaces~\cite{BKS18}]
% \label{lemma:correlated-agreement}

% Let $V \subseteq \field^\blocklength$ be a linear space over a finite field $\field$ with $\Delta(C) = \lambda$. Suppose $u^\ast \in \ring^b$ satisfies $\Delta(u^\ast,C) > \delta$, and fix arbitrary $u \in \ring^b$. Let $\challengeset \subseteq \ring$ be an exceptional set. For $\epsilon > 0$ satisfying $\delta - \epsilon < \lambda/3$. Let
% \[
% A = \{\alpha \in \mathcal{C} \mid \distance{u^\ast + \alpha u}{C} < \delta - \varepsilon\}
% \]
% If $|A| > 1/\varepsilon$ then there exist $v, v^\ast \in C$ such that
% \[
% \bigl|\set{i \in [n] \mid (u_i = v_i) \ \wedge \ (u^\ast_i = v^\ast_i)}\bigr| \geq (1 - \delta)\cdot n
% \]
% \end{lemma}
